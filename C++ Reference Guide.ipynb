    "\n",
    "### A. Finding the address of a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some example code to find the address of a variable using a pointer:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int a = 54\n",
    "cout<<\"The address of a is at &a = \"<<&a<<\"\\n\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the address of a is being found by using the '&' operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Dereferencing pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "Deferencing a pointer means acessing the value stored in that address, and this is done using the '*' operator.\n",
    "```\n",
    "int a = 54;\n",
    "int * pointerToA = &a;\n",
    "cout<<\"Address of a is \"<<pointerToA<<\"\\n\";\n",
    "cout<<\"pointerToA points to \"<<*pointerToA<<\"\\n\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "1. The operator '&' is used to find the address of a variable. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int * pointerToA = &a\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. The operator '*' is used to declare a pointer. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int * pointerToA = &a\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. The operator '*' is used to access the value that a pointer points to. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "*pointerToA\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. The operator '*' is used to assign the value to a location pointed by a pointer. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "*pointerI = 45\n",
    "```\n",
    "will assign 45 to the location that pointerI points to. This can then be accessed or printed as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Function declaration without a return type, and no input parameters:\n",
    "```\n",
    "void functionName();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Syntax for the definition:\n",

    "    return variable;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Pass variable by reference\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing by reference refers to passing the address of the variable rather than the variable. Then when we make a change in the function, we are changing the value at the address, not the variable. Once the value is changed at its address, any access to that address will retrieve the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "void increment (int &input);\n",
    "\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int a =34;\n",
    "    increment(a);\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void increment (int &input)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    input++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above function will lead to the value of a being changed inside the increment function as a is passed by reference to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that if the function declaration has an '&' before the variable being passed, then the variable does not need '*' or '&' inside the main function, and neither does it need this inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Passing an array to a function\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ does not allow arrays to be passed to functions, but, as we have seen, it does allow pointers to be passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three methods for passing an array by reference to a function:\n",
    "1. void functionName (variableType *arrayName)\n",
    "2. void functionName (variableType arrayName[length of array])\n",
    "3. void functionName (variableType arrayName[])\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of each method are shown below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "void arrayAsPointer (int *array, int size)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for (int i=0; i<size; i++){\n",
    "        cout<<array[i];\n",

    "{\n",
    "    for (int i=0; i<size; i++){\n",
    "        cout<<array[i];\n",
    "    }\n",

    "### F. Function Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a precauting that is considered best practice when creating functions. This is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "When passing variables that are not going to be modified in the function, define the variable as a 'const' so that it cannot be changed by the function. Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int doubleInput(const int input);\n",

    "Note: The iterator type has to be the same as the type of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the iterator to cycle through the vector. Begin is th first element in the vector, end is the last. The iterator has to be incremented as the for loop is executed:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it!=vectorInts.end(); it++){\n",
    "    cout<<*it<<\" \";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterator is dereferenced to print out the value of the vector:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cout<<*it<<\" \";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Resizing the vector to a size of 4, and assigning the value 3 to all 4 elements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// The first parameter of assign is the new size\n",
    "// The second parameter of assign is the value to be assigned\n",
    "vectorInts.assign(4,3);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Passing a vector to a function\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is defined as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "void printVector(vector<float> vIn);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, the function is called from the main file as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "printVector(vFloat);\n",
    "// Here vFloat is a vector of floats\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Assign Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector can be assigned using the assign method:\n",
    "```\n",
    "std::vector<int> vectorInts;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Adding a single element into the vector, and setting it to 23\n",
    "vectorInts.assign(1,23)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Adding four elements into the vector, and setting them to 3\n",
    "vectorInts.assign(4,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of using assign is that assign writes over the elements in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Push_back Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements can be added to the end (or back) of a vector using push_back. Elements can be added as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "vectorInts.push_back(24);\n",
    "vectorInts.push_back(25);\n",
    "vectorInts.push_back(26);\n",
    "vectorInts.push_back(27);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, push_back adds elements to the end of the vector. Therefore, if vectorInts is printed after the above four push_back methods are implemented, the printout will be in the following sequence:\n",
    "```\n",
    "24 25 26 27\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### F. Insert elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert is another method to add elements to a vector. Insert adds elements to the location after the iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add elements using insert:\n",
    "1. Set the iterator to one before the location where you would like to add an element.\n",
    "2. Use insert to add the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "it = vectorInts.begin() + 1;\n",
    "vectorInts.insert(it, -1); // -1 is added to the location (begin + 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All iterator locations are invalid after an insert. Therefore, the iterator needs to be reset to the beginning of the vector before inserting the next value.\n",
    "```\n",
    "it = vectorInts.begin()\n",
    "vectorInts.insert(it+3,-2); // element is inserted after the third element\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The insert method does not overwrite any of the existing elements of the vector. It just changes the size of the vector, and adds an element at the appropriate location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### G. Emplace elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method for adding elements is emplace. Emplace puts an element in a vector at the position pointed to by the iterator. All the other elements of the vector are moved one place to the right. Emplace does not overwrite any existing elements of the vector.\n",
    "```\n",
    "// insert an element after the first element\n",
    "it = vectorInts.begin() + 1;\n",
    "// Adds an element at the second location of the vector\n",
    "vectorInts.emplace(it,-1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In the case of emplace, the iterator must be set to the desired location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### H. Removing all elements from vector\n",
    "\n",
    "We can remove all elements from the vector at the same time using the clear method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// clear the vector\n",
    "vectorInts.clear();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Removing specific elements from vector\n",
    "\n",
    "We can remove specific elements from a vector using erase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Erase can:\n",
    "1. Delete a single element from a vector:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// erase the 5th element in the vector\n",
    "vectorInts.erase(vectorInts.begin()+4);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Delete a range of elements from a vector:\n",
    "```\n",
    "vectorInts.erase(vectorInts.begin()+1, vectorInts.begin()+3);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### J. Removing the last element\n",
    "\n",
    "We can remove the last element of a vector using pop_back:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// pop the last element of the vector\n",
    "vectorInts.pop_back();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pop_back does not return a value."
